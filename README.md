# AWS Tools for Beginner Data Learners

This repository collects simple hands-on scripts and notes for AWS tools I personally used during my transition into data automation and machine learning.

🎯 Target Audience:
- Beginners exploring AWS (especially from non-cloud backgrounds)
- Telco professionals shifting to AI/ML
- Learners who want to start without EC2 or complex infra

## 💻 Tools Covered
- S3 for storing CSVs & datasets
- Lambda for simple automation
- Athena to query S3 data with SQL
- SageMaker Studio Lab for model training
- Cloud9 as an online IDE

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each folder contains:
- Code samples (`.py`, `.ipynb`, `.sql`)
- Use case or scenario
- Notes & references

## 🧠 Why this repo?
I wanted to document my learning in public, share useful bits, and build real-world skillsets, one step at a time.

Feel free to fork, use, or contribute.
